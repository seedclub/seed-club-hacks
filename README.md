# Seed Club Hacks

## Introducing the first open hackathon for tokenized communities.
## October 13th - October 30th

Seed Club Hacks is a virtual hackathon in support of creators, communities and the social token economy. Today, communities serve platforms. Tomorrow, platforms will serve communities.

As social networks and web 2.0 platforms mature, the value that creators and communities generate online continues to grow. Yet most of this value doesn’t accrue to creators, instead it’s captured by the platform, or not valued at all. Creators are often locked into the platforms they publish on, and are at the mercy of monetization mechanisms that they have no say in or control over. 

Social Tokens change this dynamic. They put the creator and the communities they lead back in control. They align incentives, giving contributors skin in the game and rewards for contributing to the growth of impact and value a community creates. 

Seed Club Hacks is the first hackathon focused on creating tools to empower social token based projects. We’re searching for tools and platforms that will serve creators as they look to bring and grow their communities on the open web. 

## Get enlightened with a few ideas here: 

Communication Tools/Platforms: how can crypto-networks help empower the creator and his/her audience? What’s the best place for them to start and how to execute on that? 
Dashboards/Analytics for Tokenized Communities: Once a creator has his audience, what are ways for the audience to engage and the creator to know how the community is using the token?
New means of Distribution and Rewards: Can we think of new ways of distribution? How do creators stay engaged with their audience once they have the token? 
Discord/Telegram Bots for Tokenized Communities: Tipping? Participation badges? There are several possibilities here. 
Social Tokens Subgraph/ Index, Decentralized Storage or Assets on top of Filecoin or IPFS: What infrastructure can we have to facilitate social tokens for the masses? 
What else? Open roads on where we could go here. Feel free to get weird and creative.
